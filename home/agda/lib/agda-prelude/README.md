This is an alternative to the Agda standard library that focuses more on
programming and type checking time performance.

Notable features:

- Makes heavy use of instance arguments.

- Efficient decision procedures for natural number arithmetic (Tactic.Nat).

- Evidence-producing and efficient gcd and primality testing (Data.Nat.GCD and
  Data.Nat.Prime).

This is very much work in progress, so expect major changes. In particular the
proof-side of things is very much unstructured.
